    Identification of hybridisation state is primarily performed via the
    bond type; if the bond type is BondType.ANY, it is resorted to the
    amount of binding partners of the respective atom, which can lead to
    an erroneous identification if the respective atom possesses a
    formal charge due to one additional binding partner or the loss of
    one binding partner. As an example, oxygen of an hydroxyl group has
    an formal charge of -1 if it loses the hydrogen, but still has the
    same hybridisation state. Identification via the amount of binding
    partners would be wrong.

    Therefore, the aim of this test is to verify that a molecule, in our
    case the amino acid glycine, with charges due to the addition or the
    loss of protons, delivers values for the partial charges of the
    atoms where addition/loss of the protons has taken place in an
    expected manner.
    A glycine AtomArray is constructed such that the carboxyl group is
    deprotonated and the amino group is protonated.

    Precisely, in the case of the negatively charged oxygen atom in the
    carboxyl group, a lower electronegativity value and therefore a
    lower partial charge is expected in case of correct identification
    of the hybridisation state via the bond type than in case of an
    erroneous identification via the amount of binding partners (cf.
    equation 2 for electronegativity and parameters listed in table 1 of
    the respective publication of Gasteiger and Marsili). The case of
    the positively charged nitrogen in the amino group, a correct
    identification of the hybridisation state via the amount of binding
    partners is possible as an amount of four binding partners is
    unambiguous, i. e. only represents the sp3 hybridisation. Hence,
    it is verified whether both ways of the identification of the
    hybridisation state deliver approximately the same result (small
    deviation arises from the difference in the parameters for the
    oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group in the carboxyl group that
    propagates to the amino group).
    Moreover, it is verified whether the respective UserWarning about
    unspecified bond types throughout the whole AtomArray is raised.
