class ThrottleStatus:
    """
    This class gives information about the dynamic request throttling
    of *Pubchem*.

    Typically, objects of this class are created from responses of
    the *Pubchem* sever using :meth:`from_response()`, so that
    the the throttle statuses can be read from that object.

    Furthermore, this class provides the :meth:`wait_if_busy()` method,
    that halts the execution for a short time at high loads to ensure
    adherence to *Pubchem* usage policies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : float
        A value between 0 and (typically) 1 that indicates the current
        load of this user due to the number of requests.
        If the value exceeds 1, server requests will be blocked.
    time : float
        A value between 0 and (typically) 1 that indicates the current
        load of this user due to the running time of requests.
        If the value exceeds 1, server requests will be blocked.
    service : float
        A value between 0 and (typically) 1 that indicates the current
        general load of the server.
        If the value exceeds 1, the server is overloaded.

    Attributes
    ----------
    count, time, service : float
        Read-only attributes for the parameters given above.
