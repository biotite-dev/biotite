class SequenceProfile(object):
    """
    A :class:`SequenceProfile` object stores information about a
    sequence profile of aligned sequences.
    It is possible to calculate and return its consensus sequence.

    This class saves the position frequency matrix
    (position count matrix) 'symbols' of the occurrences of each
    alphabet symbol at each position.
    It also saves the number of gaps at each position in the array
    'gaps'.

    With :meth:`probability_matrix()` the position probability matrix
    can be created based on 'symbols' and a pseudocount.

    With :meth:`log_odds_matrix()` the position weight matrix can
    be created based on the before calculated position probability
    matrix and the background frequencies.

    With :meth:`from_alignment()` a :class:`SequenceProfile` object can
    be created from an indefinite number of aligned sequences.

    With :meth:`sequence_probability_from_matrix()` the probability of a
    sequence can be calculated based on the before calculated position
    probability matrix of this instance of object SequenceProfile.

    With :meth:`sequence_score_from_matrix()` the score of a sequence
    can be calculated based on the before calculated position weight
    matrix of this instance of object SequenceProfile.

    All attributes of this class are publicly accessible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symbols : ndarray, dtype=int, shape=(n,k)
        This matrix simply saves for each position how often absolutely
        each symbol is present.
    gaps : ndarray, dtype=int, shape=n
        Array which indicates the number of gaps at each position.
    alphabet : Alphabet, length=k
