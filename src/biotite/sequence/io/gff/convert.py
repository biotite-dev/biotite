def get_annotation(gff_file):
    """
    Parse a GFF3 file into an :class:`Annotation`.

    The *type* column is used as the :attr:`Feature.key` attribute,
    the locations (``loc``) are taken from the *start*, *end* and
    *strand* columns and  the *attributes* column is parsed into the
    :attr:`Feature.qual` attribute.
    Multiple entries with the same ``ID`` attribute are interpreted
    as the same feature.
    Thus, for entries with the same ``ID``, the *type* and *attributes*
    are only parsed once and the locations are aggregated from each
    entry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gff_file : GFFFile
        The file tro extract the :class:`Annotation` object from.

    Returns
    -------
    annotation : Annotation
        The extracted annotation.
