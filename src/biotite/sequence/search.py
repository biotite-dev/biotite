def find_subsequence(sequence, query):
    """
    Find a subsequence in a sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : Sequence
        The sequence to find the subsequence in.
    query : Sequence
        The potential subsequence. Its alphabet must extend the
        `sequence` alphabet.

    Returns
    -------
    match_indices : ndarray
        The starting indices in `sequence`, where `query` has been
        found. The array is empty if no match has been found.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the `query` alphabet does not extend the `sequence` alphabet.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> main_seq = NucleotideSequence("ACTGAATGA")
    >>> sub_seq = NucleotideSequence("TGA")
    >>> print(find_subsequence(main_seq, sub_seq))

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : Sequence
        The sequence to find the symbol in.
    symbol : object
        The symbol to be found in `sequence`.

    Returns
