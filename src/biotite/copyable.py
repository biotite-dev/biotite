class Copyable(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    Base class for all objects, that should be copyable.

    The public method `copy()` first creates a fresh instance of the
    class of the instance, that is copied via the `__copy_create__()`
    method. All variables, that could not be set via the constructor,
    are then copied via `__copy_fill__()`, starting with the method in
    the uppermost base class and ending with the class of the instance
    to be copied.

    This approach solves the problem of encapsulated variables in
    superclasses.

        This method must be overridden, if the constructor takes
