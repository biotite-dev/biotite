class MSAApp(LocalApp, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    This is an abstract base class for multiple sequence alignment
    software.

    It handles conversion of :class:`Sequence` objects to FASTA input
    and FASTA output to an :class:`Alignment` object.
    Inheriting subclasses only need to incorporate the file path
    of these FASTA files into the program arguments.

    Furthermore, this class can handle custom substitution matrices,
    if the underlying program supports these.

    MSA software that supports alignment of protein sequences and custom
    substitution matrices, can be used to align exotic, normally
    unsupported sequence types:
    At first the exotic sequences are mapped into protein sequences and
    the custom substitution matrix is converted into a protein sequence
    substitution matrix.
    Then the protein sequences are aligned and finally the protein
    sequences are mapped back into the original sequence types.
    The mapping does not work, when the alphabet of the exotic
    sequences is larger than the amino acid alphabet.

    Internally this creates a :class:`Popen` instance, which handles
    the execution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequences : iterable object of Sequence
        The sequences to be aligned.
    bin_path : str, optional
        Path of the MSA software binary.
    matrix : SubstitutionMatrix, optional
        A custom substitution matrix.
