Calculation of codon usage
==========================

This script creates a table for *codon usage* in the *Escherichia coli*
K-12 strain.
Codon usage describes the frequencies of the codons that code for an
amino acid.
These frequencies are expected to reflect the abundance of the
respective tRNAs in the target organism.
The codon usage differs from species to species.
Hence, it is important to look at the codon usage of the organism of
interest for applications like *codon optimization* etc.

For the computation of the codon usage we will have a look into the
annotated *Escherichia coli* K-12 genome:
The script extracts all coding sequences (CDS) from the genome and
counts the total number of each codon in these sequences.
Then the relative frequencies are calculated by dividing the total
number of occurrences of each codon by the total number of occurrences
of the respective amino acid.
In order to improve the performance, the script mostly works with symbol
codes (see tutorial) instead of the symbols itself.

At first we fetch the genome from the NCBI Entrez database
(Accession: U00096) as GenBank file and parse it into an
:class:`AnnotatedSequence`.
Then we create a dictionary that will store the total codon frequencies
later on.
As already mentioned, the script works with symbol codes.
Consequently, each codon in the dictionary
is described as 3 integers instead of 3 letters.
