Polymorphisms in a gene
=======================

The THCA synthase catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), the precursor molecule of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

Two types of *cannabis sativa* are distinguished: While the *drug-type*
strains produce high levels of THCA, *fiber-type* strains produce a low
amount. One molecular difference between these two types are
polymorphisms in THCA synthase gene :footcite:`Kojoma2006`.

This script takes THCA synthase gene sequences from different
*cannabis sativa* strains, translates them into protein sequences and
creates a consensus sequence for each of the two strain types.
Eventually, an alignment is plotted depicting the polymorphic positions
between the two consensus sequences.
