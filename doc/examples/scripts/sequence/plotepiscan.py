Plot epitope mapping data onto protein sequence alignments
==========================================================

Peptide arrays can be used as a high-throughput platform for screening
biological interactions. Typical screenings involve the immobilization 
of diverse peptides on a solid surface to study their interactions with 
various target molecules. Specifically, arrays of peptides with 
overlapping sequences can be used to identify the epitope of antibodies 
on a protein antigen at amino acid level.

General scannings for molecular recognition using peptide arrays
are particlularly useful for epitope identification on monoclonal 
antibodies. This example visualizes the data from two epitope mapping 
studies, using a color coded sequence alignment representation
of the antigens screened. The scannings interrogated a monoclonal 
antibody (MAb) against two arrays of overlaping peptides :footcite:`Iyamu2023`.
The files containing peptide array data can be downloaded
:download:`here </examples/download/FCR3_10ug.csv>`
and 
:download:`here </examples/download/NF54_10ug.csv>`.
The antigens screened span the extracellular domain of VAR2CSA, a
virulence factor of *Plasmodiun falciparum* for the strains FCR3
(residues 1-2659) and NF54 (residues 1-2652). The sequence of 
the two domains can be downloaded
:download:`here </examples/download/Array_Seq.txt>`.

First, we generate a sequence aligment of the two VAR2CSA strains:

# in mapping the epitope. Both FCR3 and NF54 arrays, consisted of 
# 20-mer peptides with an overlap of 19 and 18 amino acids respectively.
# Arbitrary units (AU) of fluorescence intensity quantified the antibody
# recognition for each peptide. 
# Our goal is to decorate the aligment, with the fluorescence intensity 
# scores of each peptide in the arrays. We used a 
# color code from red to white for high to low intensity, respectively. 
# The background color of the symbols on the aligment corresponds to the 
# score for the 20th amino acid at the end of the peptide.

# Lets create a function that maps the peptide score to the 20th residue 
# of the peptide:

# The microarrays contained each peptide printed in duplicated spots. We
