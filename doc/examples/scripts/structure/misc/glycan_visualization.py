Visualization of glycosylated amino acids
=========================================

In this example we will visualize the glycosylation of amino acid
residues in an arbitrary protein.

At first we need a *catalogue* of residue names that belong to
saccharides.
To create such a list can be quiet tedious, as each saccharide can be
splitted into its pyranose or furanose form or into its :math:`\alpha`
or :math:`\beta` anomer.
And sometimes a residue comprises multiple connected monosaccharides.
Luckily, this work has already been done, for example by the *Mol\**
software team.
