Biological assembly of a structure
==================================

Often the biological assembly (or biological unit) reveals the complete
picture of a protein function, may it be a viral capsid or a
microfilament.
However, the usual atom records in an *PDB* or *PDBx* file usually
describe only the asymmetric unit.
For large complexes the asymmetric unit may only display one monomer or
one small subcomplex.
Multiple copies of the asymmetric unit must be geometrically arranged to
build the assembly.

In order to get the entire assembly, the *PDBx* files provided by the
*RCSB PDB* (either in *CIF* or *BinaryCIF* format) contain the following
fields:

    - ``pdbx_struct_assembly`` - General information about the
      assemblies
    - ``pdbx_struct_assembly_prop`` - More specific properties
    - ``pdbx_struct_oper_list`` - A list of tranformation operations
    - ``pdbx_struct_assembly_gen`` - Which tranformation operations from
      ``pdbx_struct_oper_list`` need to be applied for the assemblies

More information about biological assemblies is provided by the
*RCSB PDB* on
`this page <https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/biological-assemblies>`_.

In this example, we will create the complete biological assembly of the
capsid from the *Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus*
- a hetero 1080-mer!

At first we will check, which assemblies are available to us.
