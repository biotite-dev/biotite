Basic analysis of a MD simulation
=================================

In this example, we will analyze a trajectory of a *Gromacs* MD
simulation:
The trajectory contains simulation data of lysozyme over the course of
1 ns.
The data is the result of the famous *Gromacs*
'`Lysozyme in Water <http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html>`_'
tutorial.

The trajectory file can be downloaded
:download:`here </examples/download/lysozyme_md.xtc>`
and the template PDB can be downloaded
:download:`here </examples/download/lysozyme_md.pdb>`.

We begin by loading the template PDB file as :class:`AtomArray`, sanitizing it
and using it to load the trajectory as :class:`AtomArrayStack`.

# Since the MD simulation used periodic boundaries, the protein might be
# segmented over the box boundary.
# For further analysis we need to reassemble the protein chain into a
# whole molecule, without periodic boundaries.
# in *Gromacs* we could have used ``gmx trjconv`` for this, but this
# problem can be handled in *Biotite*, too.

# Now our trajectory is ready for some analysis!
# At first we want to see if the simulation converged.
# For this purpose we take the RMSD of a frame compared to the initial
# model as measure. In order to calculate the RMSD we must
# superimpose all models onto a reference, in this case we also choose
# the initial structure.

# As we can see the simulation seems to converge already early in the
# simulation.
# After a about 200 ps the RMSD stays in a range of approx. 1 - 2 Å.
#
# In order to futher evaluate the unfolding of our enzyme in the
# course of simulation, we calculate and plot the radius of gyration
# (a measure for the protein radius).

########################################################################
# From this perspective, the protein seems really stable.
# The radius does merely fluctuate in a range of approximately 0.3 Å
# during the entire simulation.
#
# Let's have a look at single amino acids:
# Which residues fluctuate most?
# For answering this question we calculate the RMSF
# (Root mean square fluctuation).
# It is similar to the RMSD, but instead of averaging over the atoms
# and looking at each time step, we average over the time and look at
# each residue.
# Usually the average model is taken as reference
# (compared to the starting model for RMSD).
#
# Since side chain atoms fluctuate quite a lot, they are not suitable
# for evaluation of the residue flexibility. Therefore, we consider only
# CA atoms.

# In all models, mask the CA atoms
