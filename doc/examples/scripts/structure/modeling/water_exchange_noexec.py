Cavity solvation in different states of an ion channel
======================================================

In selective sodium/potassium channels, the internal cavity of the pore
is walled off from the solvent if the channel is closed.
Upon activation, the internal gate opens and exchange of water molecules
between the cavity and the bulk medium is possible.

Therefore, one can track the exchange rate of water molecules between
the cavity and bulk to evaluate if a pore is open, closed, or in a
transition between the two. Here, we used the distance between water
molecules and residues located in the central cavity to evaluate if
persistant water exchange takes place in different structures of the
HCN4 channel.

The trajectories and template structure are not included in this
example.
However, the trajectories are based of publicly accessible structures
of the open (PDB: 7NP3) and closed (PDB: 7NP4) state.
