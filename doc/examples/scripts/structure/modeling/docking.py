Docking a ligand to a receptor
==============================

This example shows how to use *AutoDock Vina* :footcite:`Trott2010`
from within *Biotite* for docking a ligand molecule to a known receptor
structure.
As example, we examine the famous streptavidin-biotin interaction.

At first we download a high resolution structure of the complex.
The resolution is important here:
For one thing, the docking procedure requires annotated hydrogen atoms
for the receptor molecule, which seldom is the case for low resolution
X-ray structures.
On the other hand, we would like to have a reliable reference binding
mode of the ligand, to evaluate how well out docking procedure went

After separation of the receptor and the reference ligand,
a biotin model is loaded from the chemical components dictionary and
docked into the binding cavity of streptavidin.

Finally, the docked model is compared to the reference model, with
respect to their RMSD.

# For this specific case *AutoDock Vina* shows only a low Spearman
# correlation between the RMSD of the calculated models to the
# correct binding mode and the associated calculated binding energy.
# A high correlation is desireable to ensure that docking results with
# good binding energies correspond to the correct binding mode for cases
# in which the correct binding conformation is unknown.
# However, at least the calculated model with highest predicted affinity
# is also the conformation with the lowest deviation from the
# experimental result in this instance.
# Hence, *AutoDock Vina* was able to predict an almost correct
# binding mode as its best *guess*.
#
# In a final step, we want to visually compare the experimentally
# determined conformation of biotin in the binding pocket with the
# minimum-energy docked conformation, which is also the conformation
# with the lowest RMSD in this case.
# The docked conformation is shown as ball-and-stick model, the original
# experimentally determined biotin conformation is shown in transparent
# blue.

# i.e the model with the lowest RMSD to the reference conformation
