Leontis-Westhof Nomenclature
============================

In this example we plot a secondary structure diagram annotated with
Leontis-Westhof nomenclature :footcite:`Leontis2001` of the sarcin-ricin
loop from E. coli (PDB ID: 6ZYB).

# The sarcin-ricin loop is part of the 23s rRNA and is considered
# crucial to the ribosome‘s activity. The incorporation of the
# Leontis-Westhof nomenclature into the 2D-plot shows how the individual
# base pairs are oriented and how their glycosidic bonds are oriented
# relative to each other.
#
# This visualization enables one to see a pattern that cannot be
# communicated through the 2D structure alone. The upper part of the
# sarcin-ricin loop consists of only cis (c) oriented glycosidic bonds.
# All bases interact through their Watson-Crick edge (W). On the other
# hand, the lower part of the sarcin ricin loop looks strikingly
# different. The glycosidic bonds are oriented in cis (c) and trans (t)
# orientation. The bases interact through all three edges: Watson-Crick
# (W), Hoogsteen (H), and Sugar (S).
#
# Thus, it can be concluded that the upper part of the sarcin ricin loop
# represents a highly organized helix, while the lower part of the loop
# is comparatively unorganized.
