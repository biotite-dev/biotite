Detection of disulfide bonds
============================

This example presents a function that detects disulfide bridges
in protein structures.
Then the detected disulfide bonds are visualized and added to the
`bonds` attribute of the :class:`AtomArray`.

The employed criteria for disulfide bonds are quite simple in this case:
the :math:`S_\gamma` atoms of two cystein residues must be in a vicinity
of :math:`2.05 \pm 0.05` Ã… and the dihedral angle of
:math:`C_\beta - S_\gamma - S^\prime_\gamma - C^\prime_\beta` must be
:math:`90 \pm 10 ^{\circ}`.
