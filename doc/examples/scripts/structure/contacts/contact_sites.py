"""
Contact sites of protein-DNA interaction
========================================

This script identifies which amino acids of the phage 434 repressor are
in contact with its corresponding DNA operator.
*In contact* is defined as a pairwise atom distance below a given
threshold (in this case 4.0 Ã…).

The identified contact residues are highlighted as sticks.
