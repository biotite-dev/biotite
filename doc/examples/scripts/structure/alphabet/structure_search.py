"""
Searching for structural homologs in a protein structure database
=================================================================

The following script implements a protein structure search algorithm akin to `foldseek`
:footcite:`VanKempen2024`.
It harnesses the *3Di* alphabet to translate 3D structures into a sequences.
Structurally homologous regions between these *3Di* sequences can be identified quickly
using *k-mer* matching followed by ungapped seed extension and finally gapped alignment.

While the following example could also be scaled up easily to a large structure
database, for the sake of simplicity we will use a random selection of structures from
the PDB plus an expected target structure, which is known to be structurally homologous
to the query structure.
The aim of the script is to identify this target among the decoy structures in the
dataset.
