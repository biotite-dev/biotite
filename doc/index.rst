            <h2>Your multitool for bioinformatics</h2>

        Whether you want to find homologous sequence regions in a protein
        family or would like to identify secondary structure elements in a
        protein structure:
        *Biotite* has the right tool for you.
        This package bundles popular tasks in computational molecular biology
        into a uniform and fast *Python* library.

        Skip writing code for basic functionality and focus on what your code
        makes unique -
        from small analysis scripts to entire bioinformatics software packages.

            <h2>Analyze sequence data</h2>

        Work with sequences of any kind: from the usual nucleotide and protein
        sequences to your own sequence types created from a custom alphabet.
        Use the rapid and modular alignment tools to identify homologous
        regions or to map reads.
        Eventually, visualize your results in different *Matplotlib* based
        representations, ranging from sequence alignments to feature maps.

            <h2>Explore molecular 3D structures</h2>

        Handle 3D structures of large biomolecules as well as small molecules
        in an intuitive *NumPy*-like way.
        Explore a variety of functions to filter, transform and analyze your
        structure data - from surface area calculation to structure
        superimposition.
        Interfaces to a multitude of popular file formats such as PDB,
        CIF/BinaryCIF, MOL/SDF, trajectory formats and more are available.

            <h2>Access data in biological databases</h2>

        Obtain data from biological sequence and structure databases,
        such as *NCBI Entrez*, *UniProt*, *PDB* and *PubChem*.
        Craft your queries with the help of *Pythonic* logical operators
        instead of learning the respective REST API.

            <h2>Integrate popular software seamlessly</h2>

        In case *Biotite*'s integrated functionality is not sufficient for your
        tasks, you can use interfaces to prominent external software ranging
        from multiple sequence alignment to secondary structure annotation
        tools.
        These interfaces are seamless:
        You can input *Python* objects and you get *Python* objects.
        File creation and command line execution are handled under the hood.
