Profiles and position-specific matrices
=======================================
Often sequences are not viewed in isolation:
For example, if you investigate a protein family, you do not handle a single sequence,
but an arbitrarily large collection of highly similar sequences.
At some point handling those sequences as a mere collection of individual sequences
becomes impractical for answering common questions, like which are the prevalent
amino acids at a certain positions of the sequences.

Sequence profiles
-----------------

.. currentmodule:: biotite.sequence

This is where *sequence profiles* come into play:
The condense the a collection of aligned sequences into a matrix that tracks the
frequency of each symbol at each position of the alignment.
Hence, asking the questions such as '*How frequent is an alanine at the n-th position?*'
becomes a trivial indexing operation.

As example for profiles, we will reuse the cyclotide sequence family from the
:doc:`previous chapter <align_multiple>`.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
    import biotite.sequence.io.fasta as fasta
    import biotite.database.entrez as entrez

    query = (
        entrez.SimpleQuery("Cyclotide") &
        entrez.SimpleQuery("cter") &
        entrez.SimpleQuery("srcdb_swiss-prot", field="Properties") ^
        entrez.SimpleQuery("Precursor")
    )
    uids = entrez.search(query, "protein")
    temp_file = NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".fasta", delete=False)
    fasta_file = fasta.FastaFile.read(
        entrez.fetch_single_file(uids, temp_file.name, "protein", "fasta")
    )
    sequences = {
        # The cyclotide variant is the last character in the header
        header[-1]: seq for header, seq in fasta.get_sequences(fasta_file).items()
    }
    # Extract cyclotide N as query sequence for later
    query = sequences.pop("N")

To create a profile, we first need to align the sequences, so corresponding symbols
appear the same position.
Then we can create a :class:`SequenceProfile` object from the :class:`.Alignment`, which
simply counts for each alignment column (i.e. the sequence position) the number of
occurrences for each symbol.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import biotite.sequence as seq
    import biotite.sequence.align as align

    alignment, _, _, _ = seq.align.align_multiple(
        list(sequences.values()),
        align.SubstitutionMatrix.std_protein_matrix(),
        gap_penalty=-5,
    )
    profile = seq.SequenceProfile.from_alignment(alignment)
    print(profile)

Each row in the displayed count matrix
(accessible via :attr:`SequenceProfile.symbols`) refers to a single position, i.e. a
column in the input MSA, and each column refers to a symbol in the underlying alphabet
(accessible via :attr:`SequenceProfile.alphabet`).
For completeness it should be noted that :attr:`SequenceProfile.gaps` also tracks the
gaps for each position in the alignment, but we will not further use them in this
tutorial.

Note that the information about the individual sequences is lost in the condensation
process: There is no way to reconstruct the original sequences from the profile.
However, we can still extract a consensus sequence from the profile, which is a
sequence that represents the most frequent symbol at each position.

.. jupyter-execute::

    print(profile.to_consensus())

Profile visualization as sequence logo
--------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: biotite.sequence.align

A common way to visualize a sequence profile is a sequence logo.
It depicts each profile position as a stack of letters:
The degree of conversation (more precisely the
`Shannon entropy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>`_)
is the height of a stack and each letter's height in the stack is proportional to its
frequency at the respective position.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from biotite.sequence.graphics import plot_sequence_logo

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8.0, 2.0), constrained_layout=True)
    plot_sequence_logo(ax, profile)
    ax.set_xlabel("Residue position")
    ax.set_ylabel("Bits")

Position-specific scoring matrices
----------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: biotite.sequence.align

Sequence profiles can achieve even more:
The substitution matrices we have seen so far assign a score to a pair of two symbols,
regardless of their position in a sequence.
However, as discussed above, the position is crucial information to determine how
conserved a certain symbol is in a family of sequences.

Hence, we extend the concept of substitution matrices to *position-specific* matrices,
which assign a score to a symbol and a position (instead of another symbols).

.. jupyter-execute::

    # For a real analysis each amino acid background frequencies should be provided
    log_odds = profile.log_odds_matrix(pseudocount=1)

Now, we encounter a problem:
To create a :class:`SubstitutionMatrix` object from the log-odds matrix, we require two
:class:`.Alphabet` objects:
One is taken from the query sequence to be aligned to the profile, but which alphabet
do we use for the positional axis of the matrix?
Likewise, the alignment functions (e.g. :func:`align_optimal()`) require a two sequences
to be aligned, but we only have one query sequence.

To solve this problem :mod:`biotite.sequence` provides the :class:`.PositionalSequence`
which acts as a placeholder for the second sequence in the alignment.
Its alphabet contains a unique symbol for each position, i.e. the alphabet has the
sought length.

.. jupyter-execute::

    positional_seq = seq.PositionalSequence(profile.to_consensus())
    matrix = align.SubstitutionMatrix(
        positional_seq.alphabet,
        profile.alphabet,
        # Substitution matrices require integer scores
        # Multiply by 10 to increase value range and convert to integer
        (log_odds * 10).astype(int)
    )
    alignment = align.align_optimal(
        positional_seq, query, matrix, gap_penalty=-5, max_number=1
    )[0]
    print(alignment)

Only the length of the input sequence passed to :class:`.PositionalSequence` matters for
the alignment to work.
The consensus sequence of the profile was merely chosen for cosmetic reasons, i.e.
to have a meaningful string representation of the positional sequence and thus the
alignment.
